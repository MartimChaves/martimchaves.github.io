&lt;p>the &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; token carries plenty of meaning, being used in the formation of other words, such as &amp;ldquo;incoming&amp;rdquo; for things that are coming in, into us. and &amp;ldquo;flux&amp;rdquo; also encapsulates an idea, flow, movement. but tokens aren&amp;rsquo;t always sub-representations of words. tokens can also be entire words, like &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo;. the principal idea is that tokens are the lego blocks of language, used to construct text with meaning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
