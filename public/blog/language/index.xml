      <description>did you know that &amp;ldquo;uncommon&amp;rdquo; is an uncommon word? we can arrive at this conclusion from tokenizers! creating a tokenizer is the first step towards building a large language model (LLM). tokenizers create tokens that can, ideally, represent the smallest units of meaning in language. for example, the word &amp;ldquo;influx&amp;rdquo; can be broken down into two tokens, &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flux&amp;rdquo;.
the &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; token carries plenty of meaning, being used in the formation of other words, such as &amp;ldquo;incoming&amp;rdquo; for things that are coming in, into us.</description>
